# Fetch Context

The `FetchContext` is an object that is created every request and passed through the request pipeline. It contains the generated `FetchEvent`, log capabilities and eventually the subsequent response.

```ts
interface IFetchContext {
    // The request generated by the fetch call
    request: Request;

    // The resulting response promise
    response: Promise<Response>;

    // The FetchEvent object generated by the fetch call
    event: FetchEvent;

    // The service provider used to get service instances
    services: IServiceProvider;

    // Store a new log entry
    log(logLevel: LogLevel, message: string): void;
}
```
